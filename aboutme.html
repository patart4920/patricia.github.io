            <p>
             Hey My Name is Patricia Artis. I am currently a junior that attend Murry Bergtraum
             High School. I live in Southside Jamaica Queens with my mother,sister,stepfather,
             grandmother and grand-aunt. My moms side of the family is Grenadian while my father's
             side is pure American. I actually like being Carribean because it introduces you to a
             more fun and artistic type of culture, while also being very strict. And let's not forget
             the food is amazing. My favorite dish is Oxtails with rice and peas, cabbage, and sweet 
             plaintains.
